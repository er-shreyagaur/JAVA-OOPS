# JAVA-OOPS

This repository contains Java programs that demonstrate the **four pillars of Object-Oriented Programming (OOPs)** in Java. Each concept is organized into separate folders with practical implementations.

## ðŸ”‘ Four Pillars of OOP in Java

1. **Abstraction**  
   Hiding the implementation details and exposing only the essential features.  
   - Achieved using **abstract classes** and **interfaces**.  
   - Example: Abstract `Animal` class with a `Dog` subclass implementing its behavior.

2. **Encapsulation**  
   Wrapping data (variables) and methods (functions) into a single unit, restricting direct access to internal details.  
   - Achieved by declaring variables as `private` and providing `getter`/`setter` methods.  
   - Example: A `Student` class with private fields and public accessors.

3. **Polymorphism**  
   The ability of an object to take many forms (same method, different implementations).  
   - **Compile-time polymorphism**: Method overloading.  
   - **Runtime polymorphism**: Method overriding.  
   - Example: Overloaded `add()` methods and overridden `speak()` methods.
